mhood112: With using numpy, and reading this csv, Determine the field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, and free throw accuracy for each player in each season.
Determine the averrage points scored per minute for each player in each season.
Determine the overall shooting accuracy of each player in each season.
Determine the average number of blocks per game and the average number of steals per game for each player in each season.
Create a list of the top 100 players and corresponding season for each of your calculated metrics: field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, average points scored per game, overall shooting accuracy, average blocks per game, and average steals per game.

GitHub Copilot: To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. **Read the CSV file using pandas**.
2. **Calculate the required metrics**.
3. **Sort and extract the top 100 players for each metric**.

Here's the code to perform these tasks:

```python


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/miahood/Desktop/untitled folder/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv')

# Calculate field goal accuracy (FGM/FGA)
df['FG_accuracy'] = df['FGM'] / df['FGA']

# Calculate three point accuracy (3PM/3PA)
df['3P_accuracy'] = df['3PM'] / df['3PA']

# Calculate free throw accuracy (FTM/FTA)
df['FT_accuracy'] = df['FTM'] / df['FTA']

# Calculate average points scored per minute (PTS/MIN)
df['PTS_per_MIN'] = df['PTS'] / df['MIN']

# Calculate overall shooting accuracy ((FGM + 3PM + FTM) / (FGA + 3PA + FTA))
df['Overall_accuracy'] = (df['FGM'] + df['3PM'] + df['FTM']) / (df['FGA'] + df['3PA'] + df['FTA'])

# Calculate average blocks per game (BLK/GP)
df['BLK_per_game'] = df['BLK'] / df['GP']

# Calculate average steals per game (STL/GP)
df['STL_per_game'] = df['STL'] / df['GP']

# Create a list of the top 100 players for each metric
metrics = ['FG_accuracy', '3P_accuracy', 'FT_accuracy', 'PTS_per_MIN', 'Overall_accuracy', 'BLK_per_game', 'STL_per_game']
top_100_players = {}

for metric in metrics:
    top_100_players[metric] = df[['Player', 'Season', metric]].sort_values(by=metric, ascending=False).head(100)

# Display the top 100 players for each metric
for metric, top_players in top_100_players.items():
    print(f"Top 100 players for {metric}:")
    print(top_players)
    print("\n")
```

This code will read the CSV file, calculate the required metrics, and then sort and display the top 100 players for each metric. Adjust the file path as necessary.

mhood112: without using pandas rewrite this code

GitHub Copilot: To achieve this without using pandas, you can use the `csv` module and `numpy` for calculations. Here's the code:

```python


import csv
import numpy as np

# Read the CSV file
file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/untitled folder/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'
data = []

with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        data.append(row)

# Convert data to numpy arrays for calculations
players = np.array([row['Player'] for row in data])
seasons = np.array([row['Season'] for row in data])
gp = np.array([float(row['GP']) for row in data])
min_played = np.array([float(row['MIN']) for row in data])
fgm = np.array([float(row['FGM']) for row in data])
fga = np.array([float(row['FGA']) for row in data])
tpm = np.array([float(row['3PM']) for row in data])
tpa = np.array([float(row['3PA']) for row in data])
ftm = np.array([float(row['FTM']) for row in data])
fta = np.array([float(row['FTA']) for row in data])
pts = np.array([float(row['PTS']) for row in data])
blk = np.array([float(row['BLK']) for row in data])
stl = np.array([float(row['STL']) for row in data])

# Calculate metrics
fg_accuracy = fgm / fga
tp_accuracy = tpm / tpa
ft_accuracy = ftm / fta
pts_per_min = pts / min_played
overall_accuracy = (fgm + tpm + ftm) / (fga + tpa + fta)
blk_per_game = blk / gp
stl_per_game = stl / gp

# Create a list of the top 100 players for each metric
metrics = {
    'FG_accuracy': fg_accuracy,
    '3P_accuracy': tp_accuracy,
    'FT_accuracy': ft_accuracy,
    'PTS_per_MIN': pts_per_min,
    'Overall_accuracy': overall_accuracy,
    'BLK_per_game': blk_per_game,
    'STL_per_game': stl_per_game
}

top_100_players = {}

for metric, values in metrics.items():
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(values)[::-1][:100]
    top_100_players[metric] = [(players[i], seasons[i], values[i]) for i in sorted_indices]

# Display the top 100 players for each metric
for metric, top_players in top_100_players.items():
    print(f"Top 100 players for {metric}:")
    for player in top_players:
        print(player)
    print("\n")
```

This code reads the CSV file, calculates the required metrics, and then sorts and displays the top 100 players for each metric. Adjust the file path as necessary.

mhood112: write new results in a csv

GitHub Copilot: To write the results into a new CSV file, you can use the `csv` module. Here's the updated code:

```python


import csv
import numpy as np

# Read the CSV file
file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/untitled folder/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'

# Calculate metrics
fg_accuracy = fgm / fga
tp_accuracy = tpm / tpa
ft_accuracy = ftm / fta
pts_per_min = pts / min_played
overall_accuracy = (fgm + tpm + ftm) / (fga + tpa + fta)
blk_per_game = blk / gp
stl_per_game = stl / gp

# Create a list of the top 100 players for each metric
metrics = {
    'FG_accuracy': fg_accuracy,
    '3P_accuracy': tp_accuracy,
    'FT_accuracy': ft_accuracy,
    'PTS_per_MIN': pts_per_min,
    'Overall_accuracy': overall_accuracy,
    'BLK_per_game': blk_per_game,
    'STL_per_game': stl_per_game
}

top_100_players = {}

for metric, values in metrics.items():
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(values)[::-1][:100]
    top_100_players[metric] = [(players[i], seasons[i], values[i]) for i in sorted_indices]

# Write the top 100 players for each metric to a new CSV file
output_file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/untitled folder/top_100_players_metrics.csv'

with open(output_file_path, 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Metric', 'Player', 'Season', 'Value'])
    
    for metric, top_players in top_100_players.items():
        for player in top_players:
            writer.writerow([metric, player[0], player[1], player[2]])

print(f"Results written to {output_file_path}")
```

This code will write the top 100 players for each metric to a new CSV file named `top_100_players_metrics.csv`. Adjust the file paths as necessary.

mhood112: Determine the field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, and free throw accuracy for each player in each season. using only numpy and not pandas

GitHub Copilot: To determine the field goal accuracy, three-point accuracy, and free throw accuracy for each player in each season using only numpy, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the CSV file using the `csv` module.
2. Convert the relevant data to numpy arrays.
3. Perform the calculations using numpy.

Here's the code:

```python


import csv
import numpy as np

# Read the CSV file
file_path = '/Users/miahood/Desktop/untitled folder/players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv'

    exit(1)

```

This code reads the CSV file, converts the relevant data to numpy arrays, calculates the required metrics, and prints the results. Adjust the file path as necessary.

This code will write the calculated metrics (field goal accuracy, three-point accuracy, and free throw accuracy) for each player in each season to a new CSV file named `player_accuracy_metrics.csv`. Adjust the file paths as necessary.

This code reads the CSV file, calculates the required metrics, stores the results in a list of dictionaries, and writes the results to a new CSV file. Adjust the file paths as necessary.

mhood112: those values are not accurate

GitHub Copilot: To ensure the accuracy of the calculated values, let's make sure that the calculations are correct and that the values are formatted properly before writing them to the CSV file. Here's the updated code:

This code reads the CSV file, stores the data in a dictionary, converts the relevant columns to numpy arrays, calculates the required metrics, writes the results to a new CSV file, and creates a list of the top 100 players and corresponding seasons for each calculated metric. It then writes the top 100 players for each metric to a new CSV file. Adjust the file paths as necessary.
