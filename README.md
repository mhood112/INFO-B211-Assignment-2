# INFO-B211-Assignment-2

This project is designed to analyze player statistics from a CSV file containing data on various basketball players across different seasons. The analysis includes calculating various metrics such as field goal accuracy, three-point accuracy, free throw accuracy, points per minute, overall shooting accuracy, blocks per game, and steals per game. Additionally, the project identifies the top 100 players for each of these metrics and writes the results to new CSV files for easy reference.
